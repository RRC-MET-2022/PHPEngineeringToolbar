<h3>What is the Engineer Toolbar?</h3>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<p>A mechanical student from Canada was frustrated with taking notes and finding valuable information online. Most of the information was either behind a paywall or explained in very complex language. He then started taking really good notes. When sharing his notes with his classmates, they asked him to make more accessible notes. Knowing that OneNote couldn't handle the complexity of creating good notes, he set off on a quest to make his own website which could store his notes forever. This is that website. </p>

<h3>What is different between this website and Wikipedia?</h3>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<p>First of all, Wiki although great for getting good information quickly, often creates lots of confusion with their academic language. I strive for more simplistic language. I write in a different style that is more personal than Wiki and all the other information websites out there.</p>

<h3>What kind of content can I expect?</h3>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<p>More speech style language and videos that use memes, jokes, and applets to make engineering fun, engaging, and easy to learn.</p>
