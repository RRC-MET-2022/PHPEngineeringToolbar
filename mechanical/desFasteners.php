<h2>Test Questions</h2>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What does the forumla $T = KDP$ provide?</h5>
<p>Minimum torque value</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>A hex head cap screw is identified as an M10 x 1.25 x 30. What does the 1.25 represent?</h5>
<p>Thread pitch in mm/thread</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What is "Proof Load" and what is the recommended maximum vlue used?</h5>
<p>The maximum  load a bolt can take without permanent deformation.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Why would you use an insert for a threaded fastener?</h5>
<p>To repair stripped threads, improving vibration resistance, or increasing joint strength.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Name and sicuss several factors to be consider when determining a fastener preload.</h5>
<p>Joint pressure, what is the application of joining, where is it being used, what is being joined together (gas or liquid).</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Compare rolled threads to cut threads.</h5>
<p>Cut threads remove material, where rolled threads are pressed into shape. Rolled threads are often stronger as no material is removed creating areas where fracturing is possible.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What is the grade of bolt with 6 radial lines on the head?</h5>
<p>Grade 8</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>For a threaded fastener in the Unified series, what does the designation UNEF stand for?</h5>
<p>Unified National Extra Fine</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Name a significant feature of pipe threads.</h5>
<p>Pipe threads are tapered so they seal as they tighten.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What is the difference between a cap screw that was 1/2 inch in diameter and threaded UNF and a similar one that is UNC?</h5>
<p>UNF will have </p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Discuss the advantages of a fine thread vs a coarse thread.</h5>
<p>Fine treads provide better joint strength.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What is the Minor Diameter of a bolt?</h5>
<p>The diameter of the core of the bolt.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What type of material or application would require a threaded insert?</h5>
<p>Softer material like wood or aluminum.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What does the designation UNC stand for?</h5>
<p>Unified Nation Coarse Thread</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>For a threaded fastener, what advantage/disadvantage does a fine thread provide?</h5>
<p>Fine threads will provide greater bolt strength but less torque.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What does the grade of a bolt indicate?</h5>
<p>Material, and hardness.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Name a semi-permanent fastener. Discuss its applications.</h5>
<p>Rivets, are often used to fuse body panels on aircraft to deal with high shear stresses.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Why is a treaded insert able to carry more load than the original thread?</h5>
<p>There is a larger surface area for the thread to use therefore it is a larger bolt.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What is the difference between a Grade 5 and Grade 8 bolt?</h5>
<p>Often made of stronger materials.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Is every unmarked bolt a Grade 2 bolt? Discuss any exceptions.</h5>
<p>Grade 1 bolts also have no markings. Always keep your fasteners organized.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What is the purpose of a flat washer? Lock washer?</h5>
<p>To protect the materal under the fastner, or to adjust the grip length or provide a locking mechanism. </p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Why would a nut be specified to have a plastic insert?</h5>
<p>To use a softer material to prevent the nut from loosening.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Why would a distorted thread locknut NOT be used on a removable component?</h5>
<p>Once a locknut has been used it is difficult to remove without damaging the joint or part.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>What is a jam nut?</h5>
<p>It jams together with another nut to create tension to keep the bolt inplace.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Should the hole for a self tapping fastener be drilled? Why?</h5>
<p>Pre-drilling will prevent cracking in the wood.</p>
<div class="secSep"></div>
<h5>Name two set-screw point types and their uses.</h5>
<p>Flat set-screw require a flat section on the shaft of to hold the part in place. Half dogs require a small hole to keep the pulley in place.</p>
