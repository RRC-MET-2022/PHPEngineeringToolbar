<H1>Welcome to Fluid Mechanics</H1>
<p>This section describes the math and science behind everyday fluids. From the air we breath to the physics behind all things hydraulic, fluid mechanics is an important part of learning engineering.</p>
<p>This section will be divided into 2 sections:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Statics</li>
	<li>Dynamics</li>
</ol>
<p>With most things in engineering, fluids are driven by math. If you are having troubles with understanding the math behind this, check out <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"> Khan Academy</a> for high quality videos.</p>
